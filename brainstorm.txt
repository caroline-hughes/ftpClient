Modern FTP implementations use TCP/IP as their transport and network protocols. 
Thus, to connect to an FTP Server, your client will need to open a TCP socket.

once successfully connected, youll get a welcome message from server...





Once your client has connected a TCP socket to a remote server, it will begin exchanging 
text-formatted requests and responses with the FTP server.

client requests take form: 

    COMMAND <param> <...>\r\n

COMMAND is typically a three or four letter command, in all caps, 
that tells the FTP server to perform some action. Depending on what command is sent, 
additional parameters may also be required (but may not). All FTP requests end with \r\n.


the server will respond with at least one but possibly two messages, in form:

    CODE <human readable explanation> <param>.\r\n


CODE is a three digit integer that specifies whether the FTP server was able to complete the request.

1XX codes indicate that more action is expected (e.g., waiting for a file to download or upload);
2XX codes indicate success;
3XX indicates preliminary success, but more action is required (e.g., your client sent a username, but now a valid password is required);
4XX, 5XX, and 6XX codes indicate that an error has occurred.

Responses may also include a parameter that is necessary for the client to function 
(most importantly, for the PASV command, see below). All FTP responses end with \r\n.



REQUEST 1: USER hughesca\r\n
REQUEST 2: PASS iEjqNW5nFSpT0ucmrUHw\r\n
REQUEST 3: TYPE I\r\n
    Set the connection to 8-bit binary data mode (as opposed to 7-bit ASCII or 36-bit EBCDIC). 
    Your client should set the TYPE before attempting to upload or download any data.
REQUEST 4: MODE S\r\n
    Set the connection to stream mode (as opposed to block or compressed). 
    Your client should set MODE before attempting to upload or download any data.
REQUEST 5: STRU F\r\n
    Set the connection to file-oriented mode (as opposed to record- or page-oriented). 
    Your client should set STRU before attempting to upload or download any data.
